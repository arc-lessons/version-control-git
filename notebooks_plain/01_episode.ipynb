You can think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can play back each change and end up with your latest version.\n\n![Changes Are Saved Sequentially](../images/play-changes.svg)\n\nOnce you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you can then think about “playing back” different sets of changes onto the base document and getting different versions of the document. For example, two users can make independent sets of changes based on the same document.\n\n![Different Versions Can be Saved](../images/versions.svg)\n\nUnless there are conflicts, you can even play two sets of changes onto the same base document.\n\n![Multiple Versions Can be Merged](../images/merge.svg)"

Tools like RCS, CVS, or Subversion have been around since the early 1980s and are used by many large companies. However, many of these are now becoming considered as legacy systems due to various limitations in their capabilities. In particular, the more modern systems, such as Git and Mercurial are distributed, meaning that they do not need a centralized server to host the repository. These modern systems also include powerful merging tools that make it possible for multiple authors to work within the same files concurrently."
